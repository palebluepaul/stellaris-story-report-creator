Give me a first contact report on encounting an alien race called the Crypospherians, they are inhabitants of icy planets and moons, Cryospherians are cold-adapted hexapodal creatures that derive energy from nuclear reactions within their internal crystal lattice structure. Liquid methane serves as their circulatory fluid, transferring nutrients and maintaining optimal temperatures for internal nuclear reactions. Cryospherians communicate through extremely low-frequency radio waves produced by small electromagnetic organs.
